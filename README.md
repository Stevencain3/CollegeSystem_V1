___

## Overview
___
This repository contains the first version of our College Database design using MySQL Workbench (EER Diagram + Forward Engineering).
    It models a simplified college environment with students, faculty, admins, courses, semesters, rooms, enrollment, and grades.
    
## This database includes the following core entities
___
* People - stores all individuals (students, admins, faculty) with roles.
* Departments - academic departments offering courses.
* Semesters - academic terms (e.g., Fall 2025).
* Courses - connected to a semester, section, and assigned faculty.
* Rooms - classrooms with seating capacity constraints.
* Enrollment - mapping of students to courses.
* Letter Grades - assigned to students through enrollment records.
* Each table includes primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and not-null requirements to maintain integrity.
